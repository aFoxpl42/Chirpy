# Basic Local Server Build in Go
Little project which I've been working on for the past week. 
This is a part of [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) learn web servers course.
## What have I learned from this course
- ==Efficiently using different packages==  
- How to problem/bug solve on my own.
- Somehow properly splitting my code into packages and files. 
* Previously I didn't understand the wording in documentation of different packages and I didn't understand what certain function/method takes as an parameter and what is being returned. Now that I had to operate on different packages on my own I had to do this completly by myself and I get this now. :happy:

## Conclusion
This was by far my favorite course from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) so far. 
I have really enjoyed the step by step walkthrough and enjoyed every minute of building this server. 


**BTW its my 4th day without gaming :happy:**
