# Basic Local Server Build in Go
Little project which I've been working on for the past week. 
This is a part of [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) learn web servers course.
## What have I learned from this course
- **Efficiently using different packages***  
- How to problem/bug solve on my own.
- Somehow properly splitting my code into packages and files.
